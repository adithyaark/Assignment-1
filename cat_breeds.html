        <h2>Persian Cat</h2>
        <p>
          The Persian cat, known for its luxurious long fur and distinctive flat
          face, is a medium to large breed characterized by its round head and
          short muzzle. These cats are typically affectionate, gentle, and enjoy
          a calm environment, making them ideal companions. Persian cats weigh
          between 7 and 12 pounds and stand about 10 to 15 inches tall. Their
          coats come in a variety of colors and patterns, requiring regular
          grooming to prevent matting. They are known for their sweet
          temperament, often forming strong bonds with their owners. Persians
          are not very active, preferring to lounge and relax, which suits a
          quieter home environment.

        <h2>Bengal Cat</h2>
        <p>
          The Bengal cat is known for its striking, wild appearance, resembling
          that of a leopard or ocelot. They have a distinctive coat that
          features spots or marbled patterns and a golden shimmer due to their
          leopard cat ancestry. Bengals are energetic, playful, and highly
          social, often requiring mental and physical stimulation. They are also
          known for their intelligence and can be trained to perform tricks or

          similar to suede or chamois. This breed is highly affectionate,
          sociable, and loves to be the center of attention. Despite their
          hairlessness, Sphynx cats are known for their high energy and playful
          nature. They require regular skin care to maintain their health and
